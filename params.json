MV disease is a nonfatal, dengue-like.\r\n\r\n### Terzian ACB et al. (2015) Isolation and Characterization of Mayaro Virus from a Human in Acre, Brazil.

First isolated in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954, it was reported in several countries within the tropical.\r\n\r\n### Auguste AJ et al. (2015) Evolutionary and Ecological Characterization of Mayaro Virus Strains Isolated during an Outbreak, Venezuela, 2010. Emerg Infect Dis 21: 1742-50.10.3201/eid2110.141660 \r\n [Auguste2014.pdf](https://github.com/mjmillerlab/reading-list/files/83710/Auguste2014.pdf)\r\n<br>\r\nIn 2010, an outbreak of febrile illness with arthralgic manifestations was detected at La Estación village, Portuguesa State, Venezuela. The etiologic agent was determined to be Mayaro virus (MAYV), a reemerging South American alphavirus. A total of 77 cases was reported and 19 were confirmed as seropositive. MAYV was isolated from acute-phase serum samples from 6 symptomatic patients. We sequenced 27 complete genomes representing the full spectrum of MAYV genetic diversity, which facilitated detection of a new genotype, designated N. Phylogenetic analysis of genomic sequences indicated that etiologic strains from Venezuela belong to genotype D. Results indicate that MAYV is highly conserved genetically, showing ≈17% nucleotide divergence across all 3 genotypes and 4% among genotype D strains in the most variable genes. Coalescent analyses suggested genotypes D and L diverged ≈150 years ago and genotype diverged N ≈250 years ago. This virus commonly infects persons residing near enzootic transmission foci because of anthropogenic incursions.\r\n\r\n### Abad-Franch F et al. (2012) Mayaro virus infection in amazonia: a multimodel inference approach to risk factor assessment. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 6: e1846.10.1371/journal.pntd.0001846 \r\n[Abad-Franch2012.pdf](https://github.com/mjmillerlab/reading-list/files/83714/Abad-Franch2012.pdf)\r\n<br>\r\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our analyses illustrate how MMI can enhance inference on infection risk factors when compared with NHT or SWR. MMI indicates that forest crop-plot workers are likely exposed to typical MAYV cycles maintained by diurnal, forest dwelling vectors; however, MAYV might also be circulating in nocturnal, domestic-peridomestic cycles in village-like areas. This suggests either a vector shift (synanthropic mosquitoes vectoring MAYV) or a habitat/habits shift (classical MAYV vectors adapting to densely populated landscapes and nocturnal biting); any such ecological/adaptive novelty could increase the likelihood of MAYV emergence in Amazonia.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
